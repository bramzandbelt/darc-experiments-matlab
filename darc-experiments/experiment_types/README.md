# Experiment types

We ave implemented a number of different experiment paradigm types.

1. `experiment_type_delay`: delay discounting only
2. `experiment_type_prob`: probability discounting only
3. `experiment_type_delay_and_prob`: combined delay and probability discounting

All of these inherit from the abstract class `ExperimentType`
